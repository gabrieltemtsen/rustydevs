Avalanche Hackathon Project Submission
# About Avax-Speedy-Swap
AvaxSpeedySwap is a decentralized application that allows users to 
easily swap tokens and play lotteries, even if the project is unfinished because
we were unable to meet the submission deadline.
After the hackathon, we intend to finish this project as planned.
# How to Run
